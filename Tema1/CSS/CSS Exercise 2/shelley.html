<strong>Mary Shelley</strong>: Born in London in 1797, Mary Shelley is best known for her novel <em>Frankenstein</em>, a foundational work of science fiction and gothic literature. Daughter of philosopher William Godwin and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, Shelley was deeply influenced by Romantic ideals and intellectual discourse.

She began <em>Frankenstein</em> during a summer stay in Geneva with Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron, inspired by a ghost story challenge. The novel was published anonymously in 1818 and later under her name. Shelley continued writing novels, essays, and travelogues throughout her life, contributing significantly to 19th-century literature.
